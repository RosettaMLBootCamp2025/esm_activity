# ESMFold Structure Prediction: Model Comparison Activity

## Overview
In this activity, you will use **ESMFold** to predict protein structures and systematically compare results with the **AlphaFold2** predictions you generated in Activity 1. ESMFold uses a fundamentally different approach—a protein language model trained on sequences alone, without requiring Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) or templates. By comparing ESMFold to AF2, you will understand the trade-offs between different prediction methods and learn when to use each approach.

**Building on Activity 1:** You explored how AF2 parameters (model weights, MSA depth, templates, recycles) affect prediction quality. Now you'll investigate how a completely different architecture performs on the same protein and develop intuition for choosing the right tool for your research needs.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

**1. Create an ESMFold activity directory:**

### Activity Directory Structure
```bash
mkdir esmfold_activity
cd esmfold_activity
```

---

## Part 1: Running ESMFold Structure Prediction

**Goal:** Generate an ESMFold prediction and understand the workflow.

### 1.1 Quick Introduction to ESMFold

**Visit the ESM GitHub repository:**
- https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm

**Key points about ESMFold:**
1. Uses `esm.pretrained.esmfold_v1()` to load the model
2. Runs inference with `model.infer_pdb(sequence)` - returns a PDB-formatted string
3. Stores confidence scores (pLDDT) in the B-factor column of the PDB file
4. **No MSA required** - just sequence in, structure out!

### 1.2 Write Your ESMFold Prediction Script

**Create a file `predict_esmfold.py`:**

You can follow the official example from the [ESM GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm?tab=readme-ov-file#esmfold-structure-prediction-), or use this template:

```python
import torch
import esm
import time

# Load model
print("Loading ESMFold model...")
model = esm.pretrained.esmfold_v1()
model = model.eval()

# Move to GPU if available
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = model.to(device)
print(f"Using device: {device}")

# Your sequence (GFP - same as Activity 1)
sequence = "MSKGEELFTGVVPILVELDGDVNGHKFSVSGEGEGDATYGKLTLKFICTTGKLPVPWPTLVTTFSYGVQCFSRYPDHMKQHDFFKSAMPEGYVQERTIFFKDDGNYKTRAEVKFEGDTLVNRIELKGIDFKEDGNILGHKLEYNYNSHNVYIMADKQKNGIKVNFKIRHNIEDGSVQLADHYQQNTPIGDGPVLLPDNHYLSTQSALSKDPNEKRDHMVLLEFVTAAGITHGMDELYK"

# Run prediction with timing
print(f"Predicting structure for sequence of length {len(sequence)}...")
start_time = time.time()

with torch.no_grad():
    output = model.infer_pdb(sequence)

elapsed = time.time() - start_time
print(f"Prediction completed in {elapsed:.1f} seconds ({elapsed/60:.2f} minutes)")

# Save to file
output_file = "esmfold_gfp.pdb"
with open(output_file, "w") as f:
    f.write(output)

print(f"Structure saved to {output_file}")
```

**Questions to consider:**
1. What does `torch.no_grad()` do? (Hint: disables gradient calculation - saves memory during inference)
2. Why don't we need to generate MSAs like in AlphaFold2?
3. How long did your prediction take?

### 1.3 Run Your First Prediction

```bash
python predict_esmfold.py
```

**Expected output:**
- A PDB file named `esmfold_gfp.pdb` should be created
- Note the prediction time - **this is much faster than ColabFold from yesterday!**

---

## Part 2: Extracting and Comparing Confidence Scores

**Goal:** Extract pLDDT scores from both ESMFold and AlphaFold2 predictions for comparison.

### 2.1 Understanding pLDDT Storage in PDB Files

**Both ESMFold and AlphaFold2 store pLDDT confidence scores in the B-factor column of PDB files.**

**PDB format (ATOM lines):**
- Columns 1-6: "ATOM  "
- Columns 7-11: Atom serial number
- Columns 12-16: Atom name
- Columns 17-20: Residue name
- Columns 23-26: Residue number
- Columns 31-54: X, Y, Z coordinates
- **Columns 61-66: B-factor (where pLDDT is stored!)**

### 2.2 Extract pLDDT Scores

**We've provided a script `extract_plddt.py` (see below) that works for both ESMFold and AlphaFold2 PDB files.**

**Run it on your ESMFold prediction:**
```bash
python extract_plddt.py esmfold_gfp.pdb
```

**Run it on your AlphaFold2 prediction from yesterday:**
```bash
python extract_plddt.py path/to/your/af2_prediction.pdb
```

**Questions:**
1. What is the average pLDDT for ESMFold vs AlphaFold2?
2. Which model has more high-confidence residues (>90)?
3. Do both models identify the same low-confidence regions?

### 2.3 Visualize Confidence Scores in PyMOL

**Load your ESMFold structure and color by confidence:**
```python
load esmfold_gfp.pdb
# Color by B-factor (pLDDT): blue = high confidence, red = low confidence
spectrum b, blue_white_red, minimum=50, maximum=100
```

**Identify and display low confidence regions:**
```python
# Select residues with low confidence
select low_conf, b < 70
show sticks, low_conf
color yellow, low_conf
```

**Compare to AlphaFold2 visually:**
- Do the same for your AF2 prediction
- Are low-confidence regions in similar locations?

---

## Part 3: Direct Comparison - ESMFold vs AlphaFold2

**Goal:** Compare the two predictions structurally and assess accuracy.

### 3.1 Prepare for Comparison

**You need:**
1. Your ESMFold prediction: `esmfold_gfp.pdb` (from Part 1)
2. Your AlphaFold2 prediction from yesterday (ColabFold output)
3. The experimental crystal structure of GFP from PDB

**Download the crystal structure:**
```bash
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/1GFL.pdb -O 1gfl_native.pdb
```

### 3.2 Visual Comparison in PyMOL

**Load and align all three structures:**

```python
# Load all structures
load 1gfl_native.pdb, native
load path/to/af2_prediction.pdb, af2
load esmfold_gfp.pdb, esmfold

# Align both predictions to the native structure
align af2, native
align esmfold, native

# Display with different colors
hide everything
show cartoon
color green, native
color cyan, af2
color magenta, esmfold
```

**Analysis questions:**
1. Do ESMFold and AF2 agree on the overall fold?
2. Where are the major differences (if any)?
3. Which one looks closer to the native structure?
4. Are differences in well-structured regions (beta-barrel) or loops?

### 3.3 Calculate RMSD

**In PyMOL, calculate RMSD for each comparison:**

Use the same approach you used in Activity 1. If you're feeling confident, try writing a PyMOL script to automate this!

```python
# In PyMOL:
rms_print af2, native
rms_print esmfold, native
rms_print af2, esmfold
```

**Record your results:**

| Comparison | RMSD (Å) | Interpretation |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| AF2 → Native | | Better accuracy = lower RMSD |
| ESMFold → Native | | |
| AF2 ↔ ESMFold | | Agreement < 2Å is good |

**Discussion points:**
- Which model is more accurate for GFP?
- Do the two models agree with each other (RMSD < 2Å)?
- Given that both are trained on different data, what does their agreement (or disagreement) tell you?

## Part 4: Exploring ESMFold Features ⭐ OPTIONAL - Advanced Users

**⏰ Due to time constraints, this section is optional. Come back to it later if you want to explore ESMFold more deeply!**

**Goal:** Understand ESMFold-specific capabilities and parameters.

### 4.1 Memory Optimization with Chunking

**ESMFold supports chunking to reduce memory usage.**

Looking at the documentation, you'll find `model.set_chunk_size(size)`:
- Reduces memory from O(L²) to O(L)
- Useful for very long sequences
- May be slightly slower

**Modify your prediction script to test chunking:**
```python
# Before inference:
model.set_chunk_size(128)
```

**Experiment:**
1. Run with no chunking
2. Run with `chunk_size=128`
3. Run with `chunk_size=64`

**Questions:**
1. Does chunking affect the output structure?
2. Does it affect runtime?
3. When would you use this?

### 4.2 Understanding Model Determinism

**Test if ESMFold is deterministic:**

Run the same prediction twice:
```bash
python predict_esmfold.py  # Run 1
mv output.pdb output1.pdb

python predict_esmfold.py  # Run 2
mv output.pdb output2.pdb
```

**Compare in PyMOL:**

**Expected result:** RMSD = 0.0 Å (identical)

**This tells us:**
- ESMFold is deterministic (same input → same output)
- Unlike some methods with dropout, it's reproducible
- You can't generate diversity by running multiple times

**Compare to AF2:**
- AF2 gives 5 different predictions (different model weights)
- Each can be slightly different
- Provides ensemble diversity

**Discussion:**
- Advantages of determinism?
- Disadvantages (no ensemble diversity)?
- How do you assess uncertainty with a single prediction?

## Part 5: Speed Comparison - ESMFold vs AlphaFold2

**Goal:** Understand the practical speed differences between the two approaches.

### 5.1 Compare Prediction Times

**You already timed your ESMFold prediction in Part 1. Now compare it to yesterday's ColabFold run.**

**Think back to Activity 1 (ColabFold):**
- How long did the MSA search take?
- How long did the actual structure prediction take (for 5 models)?
- What was the total time?

**Fill in your observations:**

| Model | Approximate Time | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| ESMFold | _____ seconds/minutes | From Part 1 output |
| ColabFold MSA search | _____ minutes | From yesterday |
| ColabFold prediction (5 models) | _____ minutes | From yesterday |
| **Total ColabFold** | _____ minutes | |

**Key observations:**
1. ESMFold is typically **10-60x faster** than full AlphaFold2 pipelines
2. Most of AF2's time is spent on MSA generation (searching sequence databases)
3. ESMFold skips this entirely - it's trained to predict from sequence alone

### 5.2 When Does Speed Matter?

**Consider these scenarios and think about which model you'd choose:**

**Scenario 1: Screening 1,000 designed proteins for a protein engineering project**
- ESMFold could finish in hours
- AF2 could take days or weeks
- **Which would you use first?** Why?

**Scenario 2: Final structure for an important publication**
- You need the highest accuracy possible
- You have time for validation
- **Which would you use?** Would you run both?

**Scenario 3: Analyzing 50 point mutations of a therapeutic antibody**
- Need quick results to guide next experiments
- Medium accuracy is acceptable for initial screening
- **Your strategy?**

**Remember:** In practice, many researchers use **ESMFold for fast screening**, then validate interesting hits with **AlphaFold2** for higher accuracy.

## Part 6: Choosing the Right Model for Your Research

**Goal:** Develop intuition for when to use ESMFold vs AlphaFold2.

### 6.1 Key Differences Summary

| Aspect | ESMFold | AlphaFold2 |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Training approach** | Language model on sequences | Structure prediction with MSA+templates |
| **Input required** | Sequence only | Sequence (MSA search automatic) |
| **Speed** | Very fast (seconds-minutes) | Slower (minutes-hours with MSA) |
| **Number of predictions** | 1 (deterministic) | 5 (different model weights) |
| **Best for** | Fast screening, novel proteins | High-stakes accuracy, well-studied proteins |
| **Needs homologs?** | No | Performs better with many homologs |

### 6.2 Decision Guide

**Use this guide to help choose the right tool:**

```
START: I need to predict a protein structure
    ↓
Q: Is speed critical? (screening many sequences, quick answer needed)
    YES → Use ESMFold first
    NO ↓

Q: Is this a designed/synthetic protein with no natural homologs?
    YES → Use ESMFold (AF2 needs homologs to work well)
    NO ↓

Q: Is this high-stakes? (publication, drug design, experimental planning)
    YES → Run BOTH models and compare
          - Builds confidence if they agree
          - Reveals uncertainty if they disagree
    NO ↓

Q: Do I need uncertainty estimates from multiple predictions?
    YES → Use AlphaFold2 (5 models provide ensemble diversity)
    NO → Use ESMFold (faster, single high-quality prediction)
```

### 6.3 Practical Scenarios - Test Your Understanding

**For each scenario below, think about which model(s) you would use and why:**

**Scenario 1: Screening 5,000 designed protein variants for stability**
- **Consider:** Time constraints, cost, accuracy needs
- **Your choice:** _______
- **Why?** _______

**Scenario 2: Structure for molecular replacement in X-ray crystallography**
- **Consider:** Accuracy is critical, you need the best possible model
- **Your choice:** _______
- **Why?** _______

**Scenario 3: Novel metagenomic protein (no known homologs)**
- **Consider:** No evolutionary information available
- **Your choice:** _______
- **Why?** _______

**Scenario 4: Well-studied enzyme with 100+ homologs in PDB**
- **Consider:** Rich evolutionary information available
- **Your choice:** _______
- **Why?** _______

**Scenario 5: 200 point mutations to assess effect on protein binding**
- **Consider:** Need balance between throughput and accuracy
- **Your choice:** _______
- **Why?** _______

### 6.4 What If the Models Disagree?

**If you run both ESMFold and AlphaFold2 and they give different structures:**

**Step 1: Check confidence scores**
- Which model has higher average pLDDT?
- Where specifically do they disagree (structured regions or flexible loops)?

**Step 2: Understand the disagreement**
- Small differences (<2Å RMSD): Likely both correct, minor variations
- Large differences (>4Å RMSD): Real uncertainty - investigate further

**Step 3: What to do about it**
- If ESMFold has higher confidence → May indicate AF2 lacks good templates
- If AF2 has higher confidence → Evolutionary information may be providing key insights
- If both have low confidence in same region → Likely disordered or genuinely uncertain
- **When in doubt:** Use predictions to design experiments, not as final answers

**Remember:** Predictions are computational hypotheses. They guide experiments but don't replace them!

## Part 7: Key Takeaways & Best Practices

### 7.1 What You've Learned

**ESMFold:**
✅ Very fast (no MSA generation needed)
✅ Works on designed/orphan proteins with no homologs
✅ Simple, streamlined workflow
✅ Great for high-throughput screening

⚠️ Single prediction (no ensemble diversity)
⚠️ May miss evolutionary insights
⚠️ Less extensively validated than AF2

**AlphaFold2:**
✅ Leverages evolutionary information (MSAs)
✅ 5-model ensemble for uncertainty estimation
✅ Extensively validated, highly accurate
✅ Best performance on proteins with many homologs

⚠️ Slower (MSA search takes time)
⚠️ Needs homologs for best performance
⚠️ Higher computational cost

### 7.2 Best Practices for Structure Prediction

**Always do this:**
1. ✅ Check pLDDT confidence scores - don't trust low-confidence regions blindly
2. ✅ Inspect low-confidence regions carefully (may be disordered or uncertain)
3. ✅ Consider biological context (is this region expected to be structured?)
4. ✅ Validate critical predictions experimentally when possible

**Smart strategies:**
1. 💡 Use ESMFold for rapid screening → follow up interesting hits with AF2
2. 💡 For high-stakes work, run both models and compare
3. 💡 When models disagree, use that as a signal to investigate further
4. 💡 Low pLDDT doesn't always mean "wrong" - might indicate genuine flexibility

### 7.3 Recommended Workflow for Most Projects

```
New protein structure question
    ↓
Start with ESMFold (fast initial prediction)
    ↓
Check pLDDT scores
    ↓
High confidence (>70) overall? ──NO→ Run AlphaFold2
    ↓                                 (may need evolutionary info)
    YES                               Compare results
    ↓
Is this critical? ──YES→ Validate with AlphaFold2
    ↓                    (get ensemble diversity)
    NO
    ↓
Use ESMFold prediction
(fast, good enough for most purposes)
```

**The bottom line:** There's no single "best" model. Choose based on your specific needs for speed, accuracy, and the biological context of your protein!
